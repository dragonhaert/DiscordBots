Hi! This is my repository for different Discord.js scripts that you can also run to spice up your servers!

Here's a short tutorial so you can try these for yourself!

First things first, you'll need to set up your own bot and add it to your server:
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and log in with Discord.
2. Create a new application and name it. Note the Client ID, because you'll need it in a sec.
3. Under Bot, click Add Bot. Note it's token, because you'll need it to run the bot.
4. Add bot to a server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=8

Now you have a bot in your server, you can clone this repository and use all its scripts! To do so, you can open the current directory (where this file is stored) in a terminal and run "node folder\script.js INSERT_TOKEN_HERE".

You can find your bot's token under the bot page on https://discord.com/developers/applications.

Have fun playing around with my scripts!
